# Privacy in the Asia-Pacific Region

Data science involves the use of data analytics to harness statistics, algorithms, and other tools of mathematics to improve decision-making. A wide variety of organisations use data science techniques to extract actionable knowledge from the raw data. It is important to know the rules about the collection and processing of personal information that can reflect different legal, social, and cultural values in different countries. These disparities raise considerable challenges to international companies that work in a variety of jurisdictions. The differences in background values can also raise challenges to a distributed business strategy that involves partnering with other entities on a global basis.


The Asia-Pacific region is vast with many languages, cultures, disparate legal frameworks, and ways of doing business.
Even though data streams are borderless each geographical region faces their own security issues. For organisations interested in operating in these countries they need to be able to acknowledge differences in privacy and data protection regimes as data moves around borderless cyberspace.

## APEC Privacy Framework (2015)

[APEC Privacy Framework (2015)](https://www.apec.org/Publications/2017/08/APEC-Privacy-Framework-(2015)) aims at promoting electronic commerce throughout the Asia Pacific region, is consistent with the core values of the OECD’s Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data (OECD Guidelines), and reaffirms the value of privacy to individuals and to the information society.

## The Australian Privacy Act 1988

[**Privacy Act 1988**](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712) is an Australian law that deals with the privacy of personal information, which is the only legal requirement for organisations to protect their analytical data and something that very Australian organisation should be made aware of. The Act was updated in 2014 to reflect changes in perceptions and views of technology. The Privacy Act is based upon [*Australian Privacy Principles* (APPs)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/), outlined in the following guidelines video.

There are [13 Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines/
) and they govern standards, rights and obligations around:

- the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
- an organisation or agency’s governance and accountability
- integrity and correction of personal information
- the rights of individuals to access their personal information


A breach of an Australian Privacy Principle is an ‘*interference with the privacy of an individual*’ and can lead to regulatory action and penalties.

### Guide to data analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles

Governments around the world are developing new laws and procedures to deal with big data. [Guide to Data Analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles/) is published by the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/). 

This guide addresses some challenges related to data analysis. It is divided into two parts: 

- Part One, which provides an introduction to the relevant key concepts when considering data analytics and privacy, and 
- Part Two, which outlines how the Australian Privacy Principles apply to data analytics. 
 
Throughout this Guide, there are also a number of risk points and tips to help your organisation overcome some inherent challenges in conducting data analytics.
