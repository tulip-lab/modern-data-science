# Module: Python Foundations for Data Science

`Python` is one of the languages that are both simple and powerful. It is a high-level language with simple syntax. As a result, it is easy to get started with `Python`, and you do not need to worry about low-level details such as *memory management*. On the other hand, it is a powerful object-oriented language which can be extended by code from other languages, such as `C/C++`. You can also embed `Python` code within `C/C++` programs. `Python` has a huge standard library, which helps to tackle different type of tasks ranging from `regular expression`, *web browsers*, to processing `XML` and `HTML` files. 

In this module, you will learn the basic components of `Python` programming, and how to run `Python` in `Jupyter Notebook`.

## Supplementary Resources

It is **not** the goal or purpose of `MDS` unit to teach `Python`, though in this module, you will learn all important components for data science processing. For those of you who are new to `Python`, there will be some learning curve. However, we would strongly encourage you to take this unit as an opportunity to understand basic `Python`'s syntax.

The following resources will go a long way in teaching your basic elements of `Python` programming:
