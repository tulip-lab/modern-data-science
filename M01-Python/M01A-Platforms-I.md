# `Google Colab`

`Google Colab` is a free `Jupyter` notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. The full name of `Google Colab` is `Colaboratory`, and it allows you to write and execute `Python` in your browser, with zero configuration required free access to GPUs easy sharing. With `Colaboratory` you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.


## How to Start?

As the name suggests, `Google Colab` comes with collaboration backed in the product. In fact, it is a `Jupyter` notebook that leverages Google Docs collaboration features. It also runs on Google servers, and you donâ€™t need to install anything. Moreover, the notebooks are saved to your `Google Drive` account.

To access `Google Colab` for `MDS`, you need the following steps:

* If you have no Google account, you need to create one [here](https://account.google.com/)
* Access the [`Google Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/) from your Web browser

## What is next?

Once you can access the `Google Colab`, you can start with the official document to get familiar with the system:

After that, we move into the `MDS` modules by loading related `Jupyter` notebooks. All SIT742 notebooks are hosted in `GitHub` [![GitHub watchers](https://img.shields.io/badge/tulip--lab-sit742-brightgreen?style=plastic)](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742), so you can upload those hosted `MDS` notebook directly using the `GitHub` menu tab, as shown in the following figure:
