# Module: Data Analytics

Data analytics is related to the key step in the [data science process](../M03-BigData/README.md), and it includes techniques that produce synthesised knowledge from the organised information. Broadly speaking, there are four primary types of data analytics: descriptive analysis (similar to [EDA](../M03-DataManipulation/README.md)), diagnostic analysis, predictive analysis and patterns discovery. Each type has a different goal and a different place in the data analysis process. It should be noted that machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning and deep learning are all popular data analytics methods.

In this module, you will learn the *predictive methods*, including classification methods, time series method **ARIMA**, the *diagnostic* anomaly detection method **Isolation Forest**, and the frequent *pattern discovery* method **Apriori**.
